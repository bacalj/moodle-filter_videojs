00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.670
Let's take a minute now to look at the controls
that become available when you turn editing on

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.670
for managing the different activities and
resources in the course. 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:20.760
You'll notice that at the left of each activity or resource is this cross-hairs kind of icon. 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.380
That is a handle for dragging and dropping or for clicking and picking to move files around. 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.820
Most activities and resources, at the end of the name, will have this little pencil icon 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.480
which you can click, and that allows you easily to change the name of the resource 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.120
without having to go into the settings; you just type the new name and click "Enter" and then you've updated that name.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.200
And finally there's an edit menu on the right-hand side. 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.420
When you click that it'll show you some options.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.780
"Edit settings" will take you to the form where you manage all of the different settings for the activity or resource, whatever it is. 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:14.760
Moving right does an indent. If you are indented to the right then you can also move left to "outdent."

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:23.780
You can toggle to hide a resource from the
students, at which point it will start to show for you as grayed out. 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.200
Again that's just
a toggle. Most activities and resources you can also duplicate; 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.620
it'll just create another copy of the same which you can then modify as you need to.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.800
We're not going to worry about assigning roles right now;

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.000
that's a more complicated topic for another time, but the "Delete" button is also very useful to know about. 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.100
And those are the activity and resource controls.
